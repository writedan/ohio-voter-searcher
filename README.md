# Ohio Voter Searcher
A hacked together Java program for searching through the 
[Ohio Voter Database](https://www6.sos.state.oh.us/ords/f?p=111:1). I make no claims as to the
accuracy of the information, take it up with the respective county Board of Elections.

This program and its source code is licensed under the terms of the GPLv3 as provided.

This program is very greedy with bandwidth usage, memory usage, and CPU utilization. 
Contributions are welcome to improve on that.
