# Ohio Voter Searcher
A hacked together Java program for searching through the 
[Ohio Voter Database](https://www6.sos.state.oh.us/ords/f?p=111:1). I make no claims as to the
accuracy of the information, take it up with the respective county Board of Elections.

This program and its source code is licensed under the terms of the GPLv3 as provided.

This program is very greedy with bandwidth usage, hard disk usage, and CPU utilization. 
Contributions are welcome to improve on that. It **will** save all 88 county voter files
to your hard disk which **will** take a lot of space. You have been warned.

This program outputs data in bytes that are meant to be read by another program 
and transformed into a nicer presentation.
