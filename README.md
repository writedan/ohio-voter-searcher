A hacked together Java program for searching through the 
[Ohio Voter Database](https://www6.sos.state.oh.us/ords/f?p=111:1). I make no claims as to the
accuracy of the information, take it up with the respective county Board of Elections.

This program and its source code is licensed under the terms of the GPLv3 as provided.

This program automatically downloads new versions of the Ohio Voter Database as they are released.
It can take some time for all the files to download, and the space requirement is immense. You
have been warned.

This program directly depends on Apache Commons HttpComponents (HttpClient module) and
Apache Commons CSV.
